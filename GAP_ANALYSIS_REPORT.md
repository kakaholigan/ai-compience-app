## ❌ CRITICAL GAPS vs ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE

### 1. **NOT INTERACTIVE** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Current:** Profile, Roadmap, Gap Analysis are STATIC
**Expected:** Real-time updates when profile changes

**Gap:**
- ✅ User fills profile → ❌ Roadmap doesn't adapt
- ✅ User selects "No Visa" → ❌ Gap Analysis doesn't update blockers
- ✅ AI suggests actions → ❌ Layouts don't reflect suggestions

**Impact:** App feels like a static demo, not a dynamic advisor

---

### 2. **MISSING PROFILE INPUTS** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Current:** Only 3 inputs (citizenship, visa, business type)
**Expected:** 5 inputs

**Missing:**
- ❌ **Funding Target** (e.g., $500,000)
- ❌ **Timeline** (e.g., 6 months)

**Impact:** Cannot provide timeline-aware or funding-specific advice

---

### 3. **GAP ANALYSIS TOO BASIC** 🟡 HIGH
**Current:** 
- 1 blocker shown
- 1 requirement shown

**Expected:**
- Multiple blockers with severity levels (critical/high/medium)
- Multiple requirements with:
  - ✅ Cost estimates ($125-300, $450/year, Free)
  - ✅ Deadlines ("Before filing", "March 1st annually")
  - ✅ Vendor recommendations (Doola, Northwest, CT Corporation)

**Missing from Gap Analysis:**
- ❌ IRS EIN Application (Free, Within 7 days)
- ❌ Delaware Franchise Tax ($450/year minimum, March 1st deadline)
- ❌ Multiple solution options for each blocker
- ❌ Progress percentage indicator

---

### 4. **LEGAL ROADMAP NOT PERSONALIZED** 🟡 HIGH
**Current:** All tasks show "Status: Pending" regardless of profile

**Expected:** Dynamic tasks based on:
- Visa status → Different tasks for F-1 vs E-2 vs None
- Business type → Different compliance for SaaS vs Fintech
- Funding target → Show/hide fundraising compliance tasks

**Example personalization missing:**
- Vietnam + No Visa → Should highlight "Find US co-founder" or "Apply E-2 visa"
- $500k target → Should add "File Form D with SEC" task
- Tech Startup → Should suggest "Delaware or Wyoming"

---

### 5. **NO OFFICIAL FORMS LINKS** 🟡 HIGH
**Current:** No links to official forms

**Expected:** Clickable links to:
- ❌ IRS Form SS-4 (EIN application)
- ❌ Delaware Certificate of Incorporation template
- ❌ SEC Form D (Reg D exemption)
- ❌ USCIS I-129 (H-1B petition)
- ❌ E-2 Visa requirements guide

**Impact:** Users still need to google forms themselves

---

### 6. **ONE-WAY COMMUNICATION** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Current:** Chat → AI responds (one direction only)

**Expected:** Bidirectional sync
- AI suggests "Apply for E-2 visa" → Roadmap auto-adds task
- AI identifies blocker → Gap Analysis auto-updates
- User updates profile → Chat context refreshes

---

### 7. **MISSING COST BREAKDOWN** 🟢 LOW
**Current:** Gap Analysis shows some costs

**Expected:** Complete cost table:
| Item | Cost | Frequency | Vendor Options |
|------|------|-----------|----------------|
| Registered Agent | $125-300 | Annual | Doola, Northwest, CT Corp |
| Delaware Filing | $89 | One-time | Delaware.gov |
| EIN | Free | One-time | IRS.gov |
| Franchise Tax | $450+ | Annual | Delaware |
| Legal Fees | $5k-15k | One-time | Lawyers |

---

## 📊 SEVERITY BREAKDOWN

**CRITICAL** (Must Fix):
1. Not interactive - layouts don't update
2. Missing funding target + timeline inputs

**HIGH** (Should Fix):
3. Gap Analysis too basic (no costs/deadlines/vendors)
4. Legal Roadmap not personalized
5. No official forms links

**MEDIUM** (Nice to Have):
6. One-way chat communication

**LOW** (Enhancement):
7. Cost breakdown table
